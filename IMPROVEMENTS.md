# Suggestions to make it rock-solid

These are small, practical enhancements that align with common production usage and established pools like Piscina:

1. Transferables first: When func() is called with ArrayBuffer/typed arrays, default to transferring (not cloning). Huge win for large payloads. Consider an option like {transfer: true} per call. ￼

2. Abort & cancellation: Support AbortSignal to cancel long tasks cleanly (propagate to worker; terminate or cooperative cancel).

3. Backpressure controls:
   • Dedicated: expose a queue length and an optional maxQueueSize → reject or block when full.
   • Elastic: cap total workers & in-flight jobs; surface metrics (queued, running, avg wait/run). Pools that do this are easier to operate. ￼

4. Warm pool + min/max workers: Your Elastic auto-idle is great; add minIdle/maxWorkers to reduce cold-start jitter for bursty loads. ￼

5. Error & crash policy: Define behavior for unhandled rejections or worker exits (retry? bubble? circuit-break that worker?). Provide structured errors that preserve stack/causes.

6. SAB opt-in: Offer a simple helper to create/share SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics patterns for low-latency pipelines; document race-condition caveats. ￼

7. Pathing & environments: You already recommend the ESM new URL(...) pattern—good. Also document CommonJS usage and Node/Bun compatibility notes (Bun mirrors worker_threads). ￼

8. Benchmarks & docs: Add a tiny benchmark (e.g., Fibonacci, image resize) showing main thread blocked vs. Dedicated vs. Elastic. Also clarify “good fits” vs “bad fits” (I/O, DB calls).
